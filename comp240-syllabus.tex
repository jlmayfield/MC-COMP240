\section{Textbook}

Books and reference materials will be based on projects assigned but are likely to be a combination of online resources and instructor provided handouts. As part of their projects students will learn to seek out and work with reference material for programming tools and languages in addition to textbooks.
% Git/github
% Software Eng.? (Agile?)

\section{Description, Content, and Learning Goals}

In Computer Applications students will work in small groups to develop three different computer applications.  Each application will expose them to a different computing platform along with the tools and computing concepts used in developing programs for that platform. The platform and purpose of each applications will vary from year to year and instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using GitHub or GitLab and Git version control software. Students will also engage in peer-review of the work of their team members and the other development teams in the course. Upon completing the course students will know how to apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting, how to maintain software through the git version control system, and have experience with tools and best-practices for developing modern software applications for three different computing platforms.

\section{Grades}

This course uses a standard grading scale where percentage grades translate to letter grades as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\underline{Score} & & \underline{Grade} \\
94--100 & & A \\
90--93 & & A- \\
88--89 & & B+ \\
82--87 & & B \\
80--81 & & B- \\
78--79 & & C+ \\
72--77 & & C \\
70--71 & & C- \\
68--69 & & D+ \\
62--67 & & D \\
60--61 & & D- \\
0--59 & & F
\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}


You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or calculated incorrectly.  Mistakes made in your favor will never be corrected to lower your grade.  Mistakes made not in your favor will be corrected.  \textit{Basically, after the initial grading, your score can only go up as the result of a challenge.}

\subsection{Workload}
% number of/details on midterms, finals, project, homeworks, quizes, etc

The course workload is as follows:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \underline{Category} & \underline{Number of Assignments} \\
    Presentations & 6 \\
    Peer-Reviews & 6 \\
    Projects & 3 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

You can expect to spend most class meetings checking in with your current development team and the course instructor. Accompanying each project there will be two presentations: one checkpoint presentation and one final presentation with an application demo. These presentations will take place during scheduled class times as well. You will carry out peer-reviews and self-evaluations after each presentation.

\subsection{Grade Weights}

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of presentation scores, projects, and overall participation in the course.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  \underline{Category} & \underline{Weight} \\
    Presentations & 35\% \\
    Projects & 45\% \\
    Participation & 15\% \\
    Final Self-Evaluation & 5\%
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Your individual project and presentation grades will be determined based on the overall group effort as well as your individual contributions to the application code. Individual contributions will be assessed through the project tracking features on GitHub/GitLab, through feed-back provided by peer-reviews done about your work, and through your own self-evaluations. It will not necessarily be the case that each member of a group receive the same grade on a project or presentation.  Participation grades will be determined by class attendance, contributions to discussions on GitHub/GitLab, and through the quality of your peer-reviews submitted about other members of the class. During the final exam period you will be required to carry out one last self-evaluation and self-reflection about the work you did throughout the course of the semester.

\subsection{Course Engagement Expectations}

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on average should be about 12 to 13 hours per week.  The follow tables provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over different course components.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\underline{Assignment Type} & \underline{Time/week} \\
Class Meetings       & 3.3 hours/week \\
Project Work          & 6-7 hours/week \\
Presentations/Peer-Review   & 2 hours/week \\
\bottomrule
 & ~12.5 hours/week
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Attendance}

Unexcused absences will have a detrimental effect on the participation component of your grade. Make every possible effort to notify the instructor and your development group members of your absence before it occurs.
